# Custom Password Manager 

In this Project I have an aim to build a custom password manager. This password manager has two versions. v1 and v2. v1 uses on command-line and v1 is complete. v2 is still under development. 

## How to run v1:
``` bash
$ python src/v1
```

V1 currently uses json as its database. However v2 will use mySQL as its database. v2 will have also have and api so that the client code on the multiple platforms can communicate with the databse. 
This Project is for my personla use only and is not for production
